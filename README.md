Library to create custom UI's in MCPE 1.2+

Inspired by Hydreon/Steadfast2.
# Lets you:
- Create custom UI's
- Send/close them to/from players
- Handle the data/replies
- Include as viron into your plugins to create new UI's
- Dynamically generate window data
# How to use:
Check out the source of the example plugin (customuitest). Theres a text file explaining where the library files have to go.

Othervise compile your plugin using the library as virion, either by uploading it to GitHub and let Poggit do it for you [(Compiling a virion with Poggit)](https://github.com/poggit/support/blob/master/virion.md#compiling-a-virion-with-poggit), or via the virion library

How that is done you can read here: [(Compiling a virion without Poggit)](https://github.com/poggit/support/blob/master/virion.md#compiling-a-virion-without-poggit)
