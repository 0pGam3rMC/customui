Check out the source of the example plugin (customuitest). It is a full example of registering, sending and handling responses via plugins :)

# How do i code with it?
When developing plugins, you want to get [DEVirion](https://github.com/poggit/devirion), and load a virion from source.

Read [the virion support information](https://github.com/poggit/support) and the [customui wiki](https://github.com/thebigsmilexd/customui/wiki) for more in-depth explainations
